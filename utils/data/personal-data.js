  description: "Welcome! I'm Saitej Avinash, a passionate Software Engineer and Computer Science researcher with a Master's degree in Computer Science from Iowa State University. I specialize in symbolic execution, probabilistic programming, quantum computing, and full-stack software development. With 3+ years of professional experience at HCL Technologies and internship experience at Amazon, I'm driven to solve complex computational problems and build innovative solutions.",
  description2: "My expertise spans from low-level systems programming (C, Rust, C++) to modern web technologies (Python, Java, JavaScript). I'm particularly interested in formal verification, quantum distributed systems, and genetic improvement techniques for automatic code transformation. I believe in writing clean, well-documented code and actively contribute to open-source projects. Currently, I'm working on exciting research projects including probabilistic programming verification with PRISM and automatic C-to-Rust code conversion. Let's collaborate on meaningful technology!",
