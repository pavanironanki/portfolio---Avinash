      message: "Neha joined us as an intern at Signarama Silver Spring, a custom signage solutions company, where she contributed to a larger initiative to streamline operations and improve customer engagement through the use of technology. Her role was to help develop an internal chatbot (Signbot) designed to reduce the steep learning curve for our sales team by guiding them to ask the right customer questions and recommend appropriate signage options. From the start, she approached the project with professionalism, enthusiasm, and a can-do attitude. I shared the overall vision and a few potential tools I had briefly researched, and she quickly evaluated them—providing a clear pros and cons summary that helped us choose the best solution. After we selected the tool, she worked quickly to build out the logic flows based on the sign-type-specific paths I provided. She delivered early prototypes, made updates promptly, and consistently kept me informed—often adjusting her schedule to meet during evenings and weekends to accommodate my availability. She was dependable, responsive to direction, and able to efficiently turn ideas into working solutions. She demonstrated very strong technical skills and maintained a positive, professional attitude throughout. Her openness to feedback and ability to make quick improvements made her a valuable contributor to the success of the project.",
